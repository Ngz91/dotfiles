# Installation Guide

First install Arch linux by following the installation steps in the Arch linux [official installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide) or use the ArchInstall package to automate the installation process. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you are installing Arch as a dual boot don't follow this method. Follow one of these videos instead:

- Manual [installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRdYSGh-g3s)
- ArchInstall [installation 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sz2W6k3HkM)
- ArchInstall [installation 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoTe4uAqIHA)

To install Arch using The ArchInstall package check your internet connection first by running:
```
ping -c 5 https://archlinux.org/
```
And then run this command:
```
python -m archinstall --script guided
```

You'll see a promp giving you some options similar to this:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/screenshots/archinstall-example.jpg)

Select the options that better work for you, but in my case and configuration these are the options:
- language: English
- keyboard layout: us
- mirror region: Worldwide
- harddrives: *VM or partition hardrive here* ext4, wipe all selected...
- encryption pwd: *encryption password* None
- bootloader: systemd-bootct1
- swap: True
- hostname: *Name of the host machine*
- root pwd: *rootpassword*
- user account: *superuser name and password*
- profile: desktop -> i3 -> i3-gaps -> AMD/ATI (open-source)
- audio: pipewire
- kernel: linux
- additional packages: firefox, vim, thunar
- network: Copy ISO network conf...
- timezone: *your timezone*
- automatic time synch: true
- Additional repos: multilib

After cheking that the options are correct select Install. Go for a coffee :coffee: and wait.

After finishing the installation it will ask you if you'll like to chroot into the newly created installation. Select no and reboot the machine by running:
```
reboot
```
Boot into Arch and you should be greeted by the login manager. If you installed Arch in a virtual machine remember to remove the ISO file before booting into the machine again.

Congrats, Arch is now installed :tada:

# Configuring Arch
<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/raw/master/gifs/anime-run.gif)

</div>

After booting into session you will see a black screen and a bar at the bottom of the screen, all in the incorrect resolution. i3 will then ask if you want a configuration to be created for you, select `Yes` and this will create a configuration file at .config/i3 named config where you can add your keybindings, exec commands, etc. If you want to familiarize yourself with the i3WM I'd recommend reading their [user guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html).

To fix the resolution open your terminal with Mod+enter and run this command (The Mod key is most likely your Windows key):
```
xrandr
```
This will give you a list with different screens and their resolutions, select the one that you wish to use and run this command:
```
xrandr --output *screen name here* --mode "resolution here"
```

Next, run this command to sync and upgrade Arch packages:
```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

Also, if you wish to change your wallpaper run these commands:
```
sudo pacman -S feh
feh --bg-scale $HOME/Downloads/some-example-image.jpg
```

To make this changes permanent nevigate to .config/i3 on your terminal and open in vim the config file that's there. Then add these lines to the end of the file. (If you don't know how to use vim use [this cheat sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/))
```
exec --no-startup-id xrandr --output *screen-name* --mode "resolution here"
exec --no-startup-id feh --bg-scale $HOME/Downloads/some-example-image.jpg
```

Also, you might want to assign a keybind for opening a firefox window. To do so, paste this line into your configuration (the location does not matter but it's a good idea to put all your keybindings after the `kill focused window` keybind, that way it's easier to spot them in the file).
```
bindsym $mod+Shift+b exec firefox --new-window
```

Now save the file and exit vim.
<div>
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/images/Quit_Vim_Editor.jpg width="300" height="300" />
</div>
(:q+enter to exit vim)
<br/><br/>

Test this changes by rebooting into Arch
```
reboot
```

## Some packages to install
If you are on a VM install guest additions
```
sudo pacman -S virtualbox-guest-utils
```

Test the audio. In case it's laggy or choppy make sure these packages are installed
```
sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-{alsa,jack,media-session,pulse}
```

If you are on a VM follow [this guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VirtualBox/Install_Arch_Linux_as_a_guest).  In my case I only needed to add these lines to etc/modprobe.d/sound.conf
```
options snd-hda-intel vid=8086 pid=8ca0 snoop=0
options snd-intel8x0 ac97_clock=48000
```

You might also wanna install Alsamixer to control your audio devices and settings.
```
sudo pacman -S alsamixer
```

Open it and check if auto mute is enabled. Check [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/131857/alsamixer-howto-disable-auto-mute-mode) for instructions.

Also, install these packages, they will be needed.
```
sudo pacman -S ripgrep fzf xsel nodejs npm lazygit git python-pip thunar-archive-plugin zip stylua
```

To render japanese characters install these packages
```
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts
```

If you want to set a gif wallpaper follow the instructions in this [guide](https://github.com/thomas10-10/foo-Wallpaper-Feh-Gif).

And add these two lines to your i3 configuration file
```
exec --no-startup-id killall back4.sh 
exec --no-startup-id sh back4.sh 0.025 ~/path/to/your-gif-file.gif
```

## Yay installation

<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/yogurt-anime.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Yay is an AUR (Arch User Repository) helper written in Go. We will use it to install some packages that are not in the official package repo or the version that is it's outdated. Visit the official [github repository](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) for the installation steps or run this command:
```
pacman -S --needed git base-devel && git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git && cd yay && makepkg -si
```

<b>‚¨ÖÔ∏è[Go back](#details) to details</b>

## Kitty installation
<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/wiggle.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Kitty is a GPU based terminal emulator. Install it by running:

```
sudo pacman -S kitty
```

Then change the i3 configuration to open Kitty instead of the default terminal by adding this line to the i3 config file
```
bindsym $mod+Return exec kitty
```
You can change Kitty's theme in .config/kitty/kitty.conf. Add my configuration or use the one you like. In [this repo](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes) there are some themes that might be of your interest.

<b>‚¨ÖÔ∏è[Go back](#details) to details</b>

## Nerd Fonts installation

<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/jetstream-smile.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Nerd fonts add glyphs and icons to your terminal, this will allow, for example, Neovim to render icons. Visit [their page](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to learn more about them. We will need to install some of them, you can install and use any one that you like. I'll use the ones I use in my configuration as an example installation procedure.

First make a .fonts folder in the same directory where .config is, then download [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.2.2/JetBrainsMono.zip), [Products Sans](https://github.com/iamverysimp1e/fonts/raw/master/product-sans.zip) and all [Material Design Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/variablefont) except the ones that end with .codepoints. Unpack them and place them into `~/.fonts` or `~/.local/share/fonts.` Then run this command for your system to detect the new fonts:
```
fc-cache -fv
```

## Zsh & Oh-my-zsh

<div align="center">

![](https://github.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/raw/master/gifs/shirogane-screaming.gif)

</div>

Zsh is a Unix Shell, we will use it in combination with Oh-my-zsh to customize the terminal. Install Zsh by running:
```
sudo pacman -S zsh zsh-completions
```
Change your default shell by running
```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```
And finally install Oh-my-zsh by running
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
It will ask you if you want to make Zsh your default shell, select `yes`. Exit your terminal, launch it again and you will see the terminal in a different style.

To change the theme of Oh-my-zsh change this line in ~/.zshrc
```
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussel"
```
And load it using:
```
source .zshrc
```

You can find all available Oh-my-zsh themes [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes).

Note: There are other themes that are not in the aforementioned repository that can be installed and used. Their installation will not be explained in this guide.

## Picom

<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/disappearing.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Picom is a window compositor, in our case we will use it to make some of our windows  transparent. Install it by running:
```
sudo pacman -S picom
```
Start Picom by running `picom` in your terminal, you will see that the terminal is now transparent, but the same goes for all other windows that you have open. We need to fix this.

To modify Picom behavior create or edit the picom.conf file at .config folder, in this case the config file does not need to be in a folder. If you want transparency to be applied to a specific window open your terminal and type:
```
xprop
```
Click on the window that you want to apply the transparency and look for WM_CLASS(STRING). Then add this to your configuration. (I'll use Kitty for this example)
```
opacity-rule = [
    "85:class_g = 'kitty' && focused",
    "85:class_g = 'kitty' && !focused",
];
```
This tells Picom to follow these opacity rules for the specific program that's running. Now, the same rules can be applied if you don't want the window to have any transparency, for example, I don't want Firefox to have any opacity. To achieve this add this line to the opacity-rule in the conf file.
```
"100:class_g = 'firefox'",
```
As a side note, Picom uses backends for rendering, some of them handle features that others can't. The default one is xrender, but you can try others at your own risk. Here is a [manual](https://man.archlinux.org/man/picom.1.en) explaining other options available for configuration. In case changing the Picom backend freezes your computer, open a console by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+F2`, log in and change the backend line.

To run Picom on start up add this line to your i3 config file:
```
exec --no-startup-id picom
```
If you are having problems with your Picom configuration copy my conf file and from there edit what you want and what not.

## Rofi

<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/kakashi-dog.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>


Rofi is an App launcher, with it you can easily search and launch installed apps. It also works for browsing files and commands. To install it run:
```
sudo pacman -S rofi
```
Then run it using `rofi --show drun`. [Here](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) you can read about other options to run rofi.

Create a rofi folder in your config and add the files from [iamverysimp1e's config](https://github.com/1amSimp1e/dots/tree/late-night-%F0%9F%8C%83/configs/rofi), this will give you a start for you to customize your own Rofi theme.

There are other preconfigured and easy to customize Rofi themes in [this repo](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

To assign Rofi a keybinding add this to your i3 config file:
```
exec --no-startup-id sh rofi -show drun
```

## Polybar

<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/doug-walker-sped-up.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Polybar is a highly customizable status bar. Install it by running:
```
sudo pacman -S polybar
```
Then create a polybar folder in .config to hold your configuration. Polybar configuration deserves a guide on it's own but you can set a basic one following these steps. First copy my Polybar config files into your folder. In the same folder, grand permissions to these files:
```
chmod +x launch.sh
chmod u+x scripts/diskusage
chmod u+x scripts/memory
chmod u+x scripts/network
```
Then add this to your i3 config file:
```
exec --no-startup-id sh ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh
```

Another option to easily set a Polybar theme is by installing the themes at [polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) in your system. All the installation and configuration steps are in the repository.

Polybar is pretty well documented, you can read the documentation in [their repository](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/) if you have any doubt about how to use it or how to customize it.

## Ranger and Zathura

<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/studying-windy.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings. Zathura is a highly customizable and functional document viewer. One great benefit of using these two programs is how little memory they use.

To install both programs run:
```
sudo pacman -S zathura ranger
```
Then create their respective folders inside .config. You can copy my Ranger configuration, it will give you something to start with. Same for the Zathura configuration.
    
Some notes. If you want ranger to preview the images in Kitty you'll need to install Pillow by using this command:
```
pip install pillow
```
If there's a warning telling you that "The script x is installed in '/home/myusername/.local/bin' which is not on PATH" then add it. For Zsh add `export PATH=$PATH:/home/username/.local/bin` at the end of .zshrc.

Also if you want Zathura to show the pdf page with it's original colors set recolor to false in the configuration file. `set recolor "false"`

You can assign Ranger a keybind similar to this
```
bindsym $mod+Shift+v exec kitty -e ranger
```

## Spotify & Spicetify
<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/persona-persona3.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Install spotify using the package in Arch repo (Do not use the Snap package since Spicetify is not gonna work with it)
```
sudo pacman -S spotify-launcher
```
Open it and log in. Check your audio. Close it and install spicetify-cli, we will use it to customize Spotify theme and add extensions. Install it by running or follow their [guide](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation/):
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/master/install.sh | sh
```

Check that spicetify is installed by running `spicetify --help`.

Then run the `spicetify` command. This will create a config-xpui.ini file where you'll configure Spicetify.

Navigate to the Spicetify folder in your .config folder and open config-xpui.ini. Here you will modify spotify_path and prefs_path. Their [official guide](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation/) tells you how to find both paths but in my case they look like this:
```
spotify_path  = /home/ngz91/.local/share/spotify-launcher/install/usr/share/spotify/
prefs_path    = /home/ngz91/.config/spotify/prefs
```

After this, you can change your own theme using this command (I'd recommend doing this inside the spicetify Themes folder):
```
spicetify config current_theme "Path_to_your_configuration"
```
To add extensions, create an Extensions folder inside the Spicetify folder and use this command:
```
spicetify config extensions "Extension_name"
```

Run `spicetify backup apply` to create a backup and then run `spicetify apply`.

Visit the [Unixporn forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) to see some awesome spicetify themes.

You can use this kaybind to launch spotify:
```
bindsym $mod+Shift+m exec spotify-launcher
```

## Neovim

<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/coding-anime.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Neovim is a terminal based text editor, it's extremely powerful and customizable, and very hard to configure if you don't know what you are doing. I recommend using a neovim premade configuration before making your own, or you can configure one yourself by following Tatsuya Matsuyama [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajmK0ZNcM4Q), that way you can get a starting minimal configuration and also get an understanding of how Neovim configurations work.

Some good premade configurations are:
- [LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim)
- [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)
- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)

These are all community maintained and very stable.

The main language used for configuring neovim is Lua. You can familiarize yourself with the language by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srFmjt1Ib0), but by knowing the basics you can make your own configuration.

A Neovim configuration folder structure looks something like this:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lua
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin1.lua
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin2.lua
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin3.lua
        ...
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lsp
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs.lua
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers.lua
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.lua
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ null-ls.lua
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lsp1Settings.lua
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lsp2Settings.lua
                ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packer_compiled.lua
```

init.lua is the first file neovim loads, here you can require other files with the plugins configurations or scripts that you wanna run. lua/user is where your Lua scripts and plugins configurations are, you can require them in init.lua by using the require function `require("user.plugin1")`. There's also a lsp(language server protocol) folder where all lsp configuration lies, here you can configure your language servers and lsp based plugins like lsp-saga, illuminate, etc.

<b>NOTE:</b> This is not a standard, there are various ways this folder can be structured, but this one is very easy to understand.

To install plugins there are various plugins managers, but the two most popular are [Packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) and [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim). If you go with Packer there's an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nvim-packer-git) available, this will take care of the configuration for you:
```
yay -S nvim-packer-git
```

Follow their guide on how to add plugins to your configuration. But before adding plugins you might want to disable some plugins that come with neovim and are not used, these are:
```
"netrw",
"netrwPlugin",
"netrwSettings",
"netrwFileHandlers",
"gzip",
"zip",
"zipPlugin",
"tar",
"tarPlugin",
"getscript",
"getscriptPlugin",
"vimball",
"vimballPlugin",
"2html_plugin",
"logipat",
"rrhelper",
"spellfile_plugin",
"matchit",
```

[This guide](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/learn-neovim-the-practical-way-8818fcf4830f) is one of the most complete guides there are for configuring Neovim, if you have any doubt most likely the answer can be found there. Visit the [Neovim reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/) forum if you have any doubt, it's a very open and welcoming community.

# Some notes and resources
<div align="center">
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngz91/dotfiles/master/gifs/jetstream-sam-mgr.gif width="500" height="280" />
</div>

Congrats, by now you should have a riced Arch linux enviroment. Configuring Linux is very time consuming and takes a lot of patience to deal with errors, but in the end it's very satisfying to see the end product and knowing that with less than 2gb of ram you can have a browser, spotify and Neovim open instead of having 4gb+ ram usage while idle. And not only that but you are entitled to say "I use Arch linux btw" to every person you talk to.

Hope this guide helped you in your configuration process. If you have found anything that's not clear or wrong, please let me know, I'll be updating this guide every now and then.

## Notes
You might want to have gaps in between the windows. To do so, add this to your i3 config file and change it based on your preference:
```
gaps inner 10
gaps outer 0
smart_gaps on
```

Also, to eliminate the topbar created by i3 add this too:
```
default_border pixel 2
default_floating_border pixel 2
```

Remember to use Git to manage your .config folder, that way, if you mess up something, you can revert to a working commit.

## Resources
Here are some resources that you might find useful for continuing your ricing journey.
